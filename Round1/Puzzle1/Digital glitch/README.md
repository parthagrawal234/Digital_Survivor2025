# Digital glitch

*"Two fragments are caught in a digital storm.

The first lies within a Shifted Glitch Cipher

The second hides in an Extraction Cipher

\
When both answers are found, a final test remains:

take the same-position letter that hides within every word of the first answer,

then join it with four consecutive letters uncovered from the second.

Bind these fragments together, and the code will be complete."*
